<b>Plague</b> is a Discord bot built to assist with common tasks in penetration testing, CTF challenges, and cybersecurity workflows. While it was primarily designed for cybersecurity, Plague also includes features that are useful for regular users, such as scanning potentially malicious URLs, generating QR codes, and creating secure passwords. <b>Plague</b> currently supports 20 commands.

Before cloning the repository, you should be aware that the following components are required for the bot to function:

- Discord Token.
- VirusTotal API key (Optional).

Also, if you want to deploy Plague locally ***without using Docker***, you will need:
- Python 3.11 or 3.12.
- Poetry 2.1.3 or higher.

Since Plague is intended to be deployed locally, we decided to provide two methods for the installation in a concise guide suitable for any user familiarized with Python3 or Docker. It is highly recommended to **install Plague via Docker**, due to its extreme ease; however, you can also install it manually using Poetry.

The Setup Guide for Plague can be found [here](https://github.com/DevPlague/Plague-Discord-Bot/blob/main/docs/Setup%20Guide%20for%20Plague-bot.pdf).
